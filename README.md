# Cpp_sandbox


This is a repo where I try out different things in C++.

Source file are in `src\`, headers in `include\`.
Any libraries will be added in `lib\`.

The `make` file 



For execution:
1. First make the executables by 
    `make`
2. Execute using 
    `./bin/executable`

As a shortcut I have combined these into a bash script. To run it do
    `bash execute_helloworld.sh`

To clean up the generated files, you can run:
    `make clean`
